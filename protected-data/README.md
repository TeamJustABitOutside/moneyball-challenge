Protected Data
==============

Since the data associated with the challenge is covered under NDA, 
place your protected data files in this directory. All files in 
protected-data will be ignored by git and should not be included in 
the public repository. For safety sake, any derivative files should 
also be placed in this directory.

In order to support repeatability, any processes which generate derivative 
files should be able to start from the original source file and derive 
expected results. Being able to recreate derivative files will aleviate 
a need for protected file storage and distribution.
